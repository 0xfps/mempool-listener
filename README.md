# mempool-listener
A mempool listener for contract specific transactions.

## Quick Explanation
Assuming we want to set up such a mempool listener for transactions that call the [`mint()`](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/writecontract/index?m=light&v=21.10.1.1&a=0xe3Bd885d1e0e39Db79f0375AE41048057199F344&n=arbsepolia&p=#collapse2) function at [this contract address](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0xe3Bd885d1e0e39Db79f0375AE41048057199F344) on Arbitrum Sepolia, this listener will only pick up and return transactions that the data key of their transaction object starts with the function signature `0x40c10f19`. This is achieved by setting up a provider with the Arbitrum Sepolia WSS RPC, configured by the user, not by the code, and using the provider event listeners and then filtering out and returning only the [`mint()`](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/writecontract/index?m=light&v=21.10.1.1&a=0xe3Bd885d1e0e39Db79f0375AE41048057199F344&n=arbsepolia&p=#collapse2) transactions sent to that contract address that are in the mempool. We can use the ABI for the configured transaction to be listened for to try to extract the values sent as arguments to the transaction and we can try to do stuff with that. Refer to [this article](https://www.showwcase.com/article/14647/how-to-listen-to-pending-transactions-using-ethersjs) on how this can be achieved.
